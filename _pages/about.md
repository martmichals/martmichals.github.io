Currently, I am working as a  Natural Language Processing Engineer at Alight. I studied at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in 3 1/2 years with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.
I worked as an undergraduate researcher, with professors [Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and
[Girju](https://linguistics.illinois.edu/directory/profile/girju).

I love all things to do with text processing. Information extraction, conversational agents, and
few-shot learning are among my favorite topics to read about and do projects in. 

Browse this website to get a feel for some of the work I have done. Feel free to 
reach out with any questions!
