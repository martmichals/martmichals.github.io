I'm a current student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I started off studying Electrical Engineering, but after some time, I realized my interests lay a couple
layers of abstraction higher, in Natural Language Processing.

Currently, I am working under [Professor Girju](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/persons/corina-r-girju). We are using a dataset of patient-doctor interactions to 
draw conclusions on the nature of empathy in patient-doctor interactions.
