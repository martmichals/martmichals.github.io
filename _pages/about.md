I'm a current student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I started off studying Electrical Engineering, but after some time, I realized my interests lay a couple
layers of abstraction higher, in Natural Language Processing.

Currently, I am working in [Professor Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/)'s research group under the direct supervision of
[Xiaotao Gu](https://xiaotao2.web.illinois.edu/). We are working on better solutions to the problem of weakly supervised 
taxonomy completion, i.e. discovering hierarchical relations between named entities in a given corpus.
